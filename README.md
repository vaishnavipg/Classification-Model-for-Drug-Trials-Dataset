Abstract : 

The objective of this project is to build a classification model that classifies the side effects of a particular drug by age, gender and race which will help to identify potential side effects and minimizing risks during the drug research process.

Drug data which was gathered by academics and compiled in open databases, computational approaches for side effect forecasting will be used to create a model that classifies the trial data of a drug based on their age, gender and race. 

  I.We will be utilizing a data set consisting of 4,00,000 patients containing the following details for each patient: Name, Age , Gender , Race , Side effects .
  II.Clean and Sanitize the dataset .
  III.Preprocess the data to perform data partitioning and handle missing values.
  IV.Create training and testing sets.
  V.Build a classifier and fit the data to the model.
  VI.Check the accuracy of the model and measure its effectiveness.
